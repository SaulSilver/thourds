## What it is about
Help users to learn the most common current relevant **1000** words from social media of Japanese language by updating the words list weekly from the social media. 
This is a good way to keep learning relevant vocabs instead of learning the word "stamp collector" that is unlikely to be used in an everyday conversation.
